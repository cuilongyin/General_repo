Git – setting up a remote repository and doing an initial push

There is a great deal of documentation and many posts on Git out there, so this is more of a note to self as I keep forgetting the steps needed to set up a remote repository and doing an initial “push”.

So, firstly setup the remote repository:


ssh git@example.com
mkdir my_project.git
cd my_project.git
git init --bare
git update-server-info # If planning to serve via HTTP
exit
On local machine:


cd my_project
git init
git add *
git commit -m "My initial commit message"
git remote add origin git@example.com:my_project.git
git push -u origin master
Done!

Team members can now clone and track the remote repository using the following:


git clone git@example.com:my_project.git
cd my_project
