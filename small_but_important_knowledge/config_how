As well as the method posted by scoopr, you can set per host options in your ssh client configuration file.

In your .ssh directory, create a file called config (if it doesn't already exist) and set the permissions to 600, you can then create sections which start with

host <some hostname or pattern>
and then set per host options after that, for example,

host bob.specific.foo
user fred

host *.home.example
user billy
port 9191
so you could have

host server.to.test
PubkeyAuthentication=no
in that file, and then simply

ssh server.to.test
and the option will get picked up.
